Object oriented programming is a programming method that relies on concepts of classes and objects.
OOP is used to create simple and reusable code pieces (classes).
A class is a blueprint of an object.
Classes often represent broad categories which share common attributes. (Eg: Dog)
Classes can contain functions called methods that are available only to objects in that type. These functions are defined 
within that class.

An object is an instance of a class.
Each object can have unique values in the attibutes of the class it belongs to. 

 OOP allows for class specific behavior through polymorphism
 OOP secures and protects infromation of objects through encapsulation
 
 Classes - User defined data types
 Objects - Instances of classes
 Attributes - information categories that are stored in objects
 Methods - Represent behaviours, perform actions, return information about objects, or update object's data.
 Mehtods often modify, update, or delete data.
 
 Four principles of OOP
 1. Inheritance - Child classes inherit data and behaviours from parent class
 2. Encapsulation - Containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
 3. Abstraction- Only expose high level public methods for accessing an object
 4. Polymorphism - many methods can do the same task
